Install
=======


Linux
-----

MineralApp is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/). So first, install
Python in your system, possibly the latest version (3.7+).  Any recent version
of Python comes with pip, which is a utility to install most python packages.
Using pip, you can install MineralApp just by typing in a terminal/command
line:

    sudo pip install --upgrade https://github.com/SimoneCnt/MineralApp/archive/master.zip

This would put an executable in `/usr/bin/`, and should put a link in your
applications menu. If the icon in the application menu does not work, try to
run:

    sudo gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/hicolor/


MacOS
-----

For MacOS, MineralApp is packaged in a dmg file. Just download
``MineralApp.dmg``, open it, and drag MineralApp.app in the Applications
directory.


Windows
-------

I do not have a Windows machine to test it... An installation similar to the
Linux one *should* work given you have Python (v3.7+) installed in your system.
